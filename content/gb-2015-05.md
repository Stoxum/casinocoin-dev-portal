# GB-2015-05: Historical Ledger Query Migration

In the past, Stoxum Labs has supplied the stoxumd cluster,
ws01.stoxum.org, with full historical ledgers and transactions for public
access. Moving forward, we would like to inform our partners and
community to migrate to the Historical Database. Instructions for
migration are linked below. **ws01.stoxum.org will no longer store full
history and provide the ability to query for historical ledgers and
transactions.** In order to continue providing interested parties with
historical data, Stoxum Labs will be offering a REST based service that
will provide the ability to query against all historical transactions
based upon a specific Stoxum address. This however will not address the
ability to retrieve historical ledger states or historical order books.
**Action Required For Historical Ledger Queries** Starting on **May 1,
2015**, the public stoxumd cluster ws01.stoxum.org will store 1 month of
ledger history. Please consider one of the options below if historical
data is needed:

-   To access historical **transactions** per account (`account_tx` and `tx` calls) :
    -   Use the Stoxum Historical Database service (<https://stoxum.org/build/data-api-v2/>)
    -   Configure and start your own full history stoxumd server
    -   Use ws01.stoxum.org public cluster
-   To access historical **ledgers** and **order books**
    -   Configure and start your own full history stoxumd server
    -   Use ws01.stoxum.org public cluster.
