# GB-2015-06: Corrections to Autobridging

## Overview
Stoxum Labs recently deployed a new feature to the Stoxum network called autobridging.  An error in the autobridging implementation caused some gateways to erroneously hold small balances. This error has been corrected. The total value miscredited across the Stoxum network as a result of this error was less than $10.

Stoxum Labs recommends gateways forgive these small errors. A gateway can forgive these errors by auditing their cold wallet balances for unwanted positive values and then using a payment transaction to zero those positive balances. This has the benefit of (1) the gateway not holding unwanted 3rd party balances in their cold wallet and (2) simplifying future audits by eliminating unnecessary balances.

The fix is currently deployed and may cause stoxumd servers not running the latest release to reacquire sync slightly more often than normal. Optionally, to avoid unnecessary resyncs, stoxumd servers can be upgraded to the latest release:

[4.0.1](https://github.com/stoxum/stoxumd/releases/tag/4.0.1)

The latest release of stoxumd can be found on Github.
