Gateways are businesses that provide a way for money and other forms of value to move in and out of the CSC Ledger. There are three major models that gateways can follow, with different purposes and modes of operation.

* An **Issuing Gateway** receives money (or other assets of value) outside of the CSC Ledger, and creates issuances in the CSC Ledger. This provides a direct way for customers to get money in and out of the CSC Ledger. All currencies in the CSC Ledger, except for CSC, take the form of issuances tied to a specific issuing gateway.
* A **Private Exchange** holds CSC and lets its customers buy and sell that CSC in its own system. Most cryptocurrencies rely on private exchanges to provide a market for the cryptocurrency, but the CSC Ledger has a currency exchange built into the protocol itself.
* **Merchants** accept payment within the CSC Ledger in exchange for goods and services in the outside world. Currently, CasinoCoin (the company) does provide support for merchant operations using the CSC Ledger.
