Gateways are businesses that provide a way for money and other forms of value to move in and out of the STM Ledger. There are three major models that gateways can follow, with different purposes and modes of operation.

* An **Issuing Gateway** receives money (or other assets of value) outside of the STM Ledger, and creates issuances in the STM Ledger. This provides a direct way for customers to get money in and out of the STM Ledger. All currencies in the STM Ledger, except for STM, take the form of issuances tied to a specific issuing gateway.
* A **Private Exchange** holds STM and lets its customers buy and sell that STM in its own system. Most cryptocurrencies rely on private exchanges to provide a market for the cryptocurrency, but the STM Ledger has a currency exchange built into the protocol itself.
* **Merchants** accept payment within the STM Ledger in exchange for goods and services in the outside world. Currently, Stoxum (the company) does provide support for merchant operations using the STM Ledger.
