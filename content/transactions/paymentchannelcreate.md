_Requires the [PayChan Amendment](reference-amendments.html#paychan)._

Create a unidirectional channel and fund it with CSC. The address sending this transaction becomes the "source address" of the payment channel.

Example PaymentChannelCreate:

```json
{
    "Account": "cDarPNJEpCnpBZSfmcquydockkePkjPGA2",
    "TransactionType": "PaymentChannelCreate",
    "Amount": "10000",
    "Destination": "rsA2LpzuawewSBQXkiju3YQTMzW13pAAdW",

    "PublicKey": "32D2471DB72B27E3310F355BB33E339BF26F8392D5A93D3BC0FC3B566612DA0F0A",
    "CancelAfter": 533171558,
    "DestinationTag": 23480,
    "SourceTag": 11747

| Field            | JSON Type | [Internal Type][] | Description               |
|:-----------------|:----------|:------------------|:--------------------------|
| `Amount`         | String    | Amount            | Amount of [CSC, in drops][Currency Amount], to deduct from the sender's balance and set aside in this channel. While the channel is open, the CSC can only go to the `Destination` address. When the channel closes, any unclaimed CSC is returned to the source address's balance. |
| `Destination`    | String    | AccountID         | Address to receive CSC claims against this channel. This is also known as the "destination address" for the channel. |
| `SettleDelay`    | Number    | UInt32            | Amount of time the source address must wait before closing the channel if it has unclaimed CSC. |
| `PublicKey`      | String    | PubKey            | The public key of the key pair the source will use to sign claims against this channel, in hexadecimal. This can be any secp256k1 or Ed25519 public key. <!-- STYLE_OVERRIDE: will --> |
| `CancelAfter`    | Number    | UInt32            | _(Optional)_ The time, in [seconds since the CasinoCoin Epoch](reference-casinocoind.html#specifying-time), when this channel expires. Any transaction that would modify the channel after this time closes the channel without otherwise affecting it. This value is immutable; the channel can be closed earlier than this time but cannot remain open after this time. |
| `DestinationTag` | Number    | UInt32            | _(Optional)_ Arbitrary tag to further specify the destination for this payment channel, such as a hosted recipient at the destination address. |
| `SourceTag`      | Number    | UInt32            | _(Optional)_ Arbitrary tag to further specify the source for this payment channel, such as a hosted sender at the source address. |
